        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Automata, Computability, and Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            What are the fundamental capabilities and limiation of computers?
        </p>
        <h3>Complexity Theory</h3>
        <p>
            What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?
        </p>
        <h3>Computability Theory</h3>
        <p>
            Can computer develop a computer algorithm can perform the task?
        </p>
        <h3>Automata Theory</h3>
        <p>
            Automata theoryd deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical
            models of computation. These models play a role in several applied areas of 
            computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finite Automaton uses text processing, compilers and hardware design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Context-Free Grammear is used programming languages and artifical intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automata will allow practice with formal definitions of computation as it introduces
            concepts relevant to other nontheoretical areas of computer science.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Mathematical Notions and Terminology</h2>
        <h3>Sets</h3>
        
        <p>
            Set is a group of objects represented as a unit. Elements and Members are objects 
            in a sets. Elements can be numbers, symbols, and even other sets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <p> A = 7 </p><p> A ∈ {7,21,57} </p> <p> A is a subset of S </p>
            <p> B = 8 </p><p> B !∈ {7,21,57 </p> <p> B is not a subset of S </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            if A = {7,21,57} then A is a proper subset of S.
