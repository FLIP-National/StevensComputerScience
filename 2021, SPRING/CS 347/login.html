        Internet of Things: Hugs The Rail is a project that will produce a product to railroad users and 
        supporters to enhance the ride. These changes will include being able to make decisions locally 
        in absence of cellular and wifi connectivity back the offices, being able to capture data 
        from the locomotives and its surrounding environment, issuing an analytic engine on board to 
        process as much information to safely guide passengers as well as the conductor on their destination, 
        make decision that is passed on the locomotive control system, providing room for the operator 
        to enter commands to receive status, and the ability to download the latest rules from the cloud 
        into the engine. The Little Engineers That Could, Team Eight is a talented team filled with curiosity, 
        structured by organized members, and constructed with knowledge to perform these tasks.

        Currently, the train system involved with the Hugs the Rail system is completely reliant on the internet 
        and network connection it has. If a scenario occurred where the internet / network connection was lost, 
        however, the trains would be lost with no idea on where to go or what to do incase of an emergency. 
        This is precisely the problem at hand. The Hugs the Rail system will implement sensors into these trains, 
        which function locally, not relying on a network connection with the outside world, so that the trains will 
        function in a scenario where there is no possible way to connect to the internet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Locomotives used by Hugs the Rails should aim to get every package onboard as quickly and efficiently 
        as possible so that the people and companies can get to their parcels in a timely manner. They 
        should also be ensured that all systems are updated for their safety alongside the new protocols.
